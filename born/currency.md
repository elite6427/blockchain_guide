## Speaking of digital currency

Currency is a great invention in the development of human civilization. The most important functions include the measure of value, the means of circulation and the means of storage. It is hard to imagine leaving the money, whether the huge and complex economic and financial system of modern society can sustain its operation.

Historically, the currency has undergone many stages of evolution, including physical currency, metal currency, alternative currency, credit currency, electronic currency, digital currency and so on. The value of money itself relies on the value of the real value, the credit value of the issuer, and the value of trust in the information system (including algorithms, math, cryptography, software, etc.) that emerge today.

*Note: The earliest accounts of money in China, "Xia Yu Xuan Yuan" appeared in the constant width "salt iron on the wrong coin."*

### Demand

Common equivalents can be used as currency. However, usually the most common or standard paper currency, not only easy to carry, not easy to imitate, but also relatively easy to fake.

*Note that strictly speaking, money is not equal to cash or currency, and the currency is broader.*

Some people think that the credit card relative to the form of banknotes more convenient. Monetary provides better anonymity than a centralized payment system such as a credit card. In addition, once encountered system failure, off network, there is no credit card machine, credit card is not available.

Both monetary and credit card models require additional systems (such as banks) to perform operations such as production, distribution, and management, posing a significant additional cost and risk. Security incidents such as counterfeiting, credit card fraud, piracy and money transfer are commonplace.

Naturally, if a digital currency can be realized, maintaining these characteristics of the existing currency and eliminating the defects of the paper currency will undoubtedly bring about enormous social changes and greatly increase the operational efficiency of economic activities.

### Compare

Let's compare the current digital currency with real-life banknotes:

| Attributes | Analysis | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Portable | There should be no dispute at this point, and it is clear that the digital form of the currency wins. | Digital currency |
| Security | This point should be said that both have their own advantages, but the digital currency may be slightly better. Banknotes rely on the sophistication of various designs (paper, ink, dark lines, mezzanine, etc.), and digital currency relies on cryptography. In fact, counterfeiting of banknotes occurs from time to time, but counterfeiting of digital currencies has yet to be realized. | Digital currency |
| Discrimination | Even if banknotes rely on bill validators, there will still be miscarriage of justice, and digital currency can not possibly make mistakes based on cryptography. Digital currency wins. | Digital currency |
| anonymous | Often, both provide good anonymity. But none of them defensively intended to track. | draw |
| transaction | For paper currency, who holds the paper currency is the legal owner, the transaction can be completed by transferring the paper money itself. This is more complicated for digital currencies because any digital item can be copied and therefore requires additional mechanisms. To this end, Bitcoin invented the blockchain technology to ensure reliable and tamper-proof transactions. | Banknotes |
| Resources | The cost of producing a 100-dollar banknote is around $ 0.1. The production cost of 100 denominations of Renminbi is numerous, but it is estimated that it should range from a few cents to several cents. The resources that digital money consume are more complex, worst-case estimates, and how much (and often more) to consume. | Banknotes |
| issued | The issue of banknotes requires the participation of third-party agencies, and digital currencies are distributed through distributed algorithms. In human history, inflation and deflation are often caused by unjust issuance of currency; there is no opportunity for digital currency to be validated yet, and its performance in this respect remains to be seen. | draw |

Visible, digital currency is not in all areas better than the existing monetary form. It is not a rigorous attitude to advocate digital currency in all fields without any preconditions and should be analyzed in a concrete situation-specific manner. In fact, a closer look at the current trading agencies that support digital currencies will find its way, and no digital currency currently has the currency function.

Finally, while the current digital currency "experiment" has been a great success, the obvious limitations are obvious: the distributed ledger technology it relies on lacks the test of large-scale scenarios; performance and security still to be improved; resource consumption Too high and so on. These issues still need to be further development of related technologies.

### Achieve the challenge

Designing and implementing a digital currency is not easy.

In real life, delivery of value is relatively easy because of the transferability of paper money. But because electronic content has a natural cost of zero duplication, the transfer of value can not be done by sending electronic content. Holders can try to send the same electronic money to multiple people. This is called "Double-Spent."

Some may argue that the currency in the current bank is electronic, because the assets are recorded by numbers in the account. To put it right, the electronic money model, sometimes referred to as "digital currency 1.0", actually assumes the existence of a secure third-party bookkeeping facility that uses credit as a collateral to complete the transaction.

This centralized control of digital currency is relatively straightforward but requires a centralized control system. However, in many cases, there is no secure third-party book-keeping agency that serves as a center-controlled role.

For example, the two countries may lack sufficient foreign exchange reserves; the anonymous parties on the Internet make direct purchases and sales; the two institutions in the transaction do not trust each other and can not find a third party guarantee that is mutually agreed upon; the exchange rate changes; may not be able to connect to Third-party systems; third-party systems may fail ...

To sum up, in the decentralized scenario, there are several challenges:

* Currency security: who is responsible for verifying currency;
* Currency transactions: how to determine the transfer of money from one party to another party;
* Avoiding double payments: How to avoid double payments.

Well, this is actually not easy.

### Bitcoin appears

How to implement a digital currency system in the absence of a third-party bookkeeping institution?

For nearly three decades, digital currency technology has been working in this direction and has undergone several generations of evolution, including [e-Cash](http://www.hit.bme.hu/~buttyan/courses/BMEVIHIM219/2009/Chaum.BlindSigForPayment.1982.PDF), [HashCash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash), [B-money](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt) and others.

In 1983, [David Chaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chaum) first proposed [ecash](http://www.hit.bme.hu/~buttyan/courses/BMEVIHIM219/2009/Chaum.BlindSigForPayment.1982.PDF) and in 1989 created [Digicash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digicash). The ecash system is the first anonymous cryptographic electronic money (or electronic cash system), based on the blind signature technology invented by David Chaum, which was used in bank micro-payments. ecash relied on a centralized intermediary, causing it to eventually fail.

In 1997, [Adam Back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Back) invented [Hashcash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash) to solve DoS attacks in mail systems. For the first time, Hashcash proposed using a Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism to obtain credits, which was later adopted by subsequent digital currency technology.

In 1998, [Wei Dai](http://www.weidai.com) proposed [B-money](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt), introducing PoW into the digital money generation process. B-money is also the first digital currency to be de-centralized. It is conceptually better, but unfortunately it failed to come up with a specific design implementation.

All of these digital currencies depend more or less on the credit guarantees of a third-party system. Until the advent of bitcoin, PoW and consensus mechanism were combined together, for the first time in a practical sense to achieve a set of decentralized digital currency system .

The Bitcoin network, without any regulatory agency itself, ensures the success of all transactions through mathematical and cryptographic principles. The value of Bitcoin itself is endorsed by the computational power behind it. It also motivates people to start thinking about how to measure value and how to issue currency in the digital world of the future.

Currently, there are two more influential models of digital currency, one is the choice of paypal with the existing system to become a proxy; one is based on bitcoin completely discarded the existing system of distributed technology.

It is still hard to tell which model will be the mainstream of the future, and even more advanced technologies may emerge in the future. But exploring the design of digital currencies like Bitcoin is going to be a very interesting thing.
